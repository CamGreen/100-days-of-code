# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 15 January 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I decided to fix an internet GIS application I developed back in 2018 using OpenLayers for production. First thing I did was reinstall Node.js & npm with OpenLayers, this took a little longer than expected because I could remember how to do it correctly so had to spend a bit of time reading. Eventually got it to work when I selected the correct directory using mkdir new-project && cd new-project. Once this was correctly installed, the code worked. 

The first thing I tried to fix was the spatial layers that were no longer being displayed. The error came from the url being used to call the layers was incorrect. I fixed this and discovered a new error. The new error I was getting is a net::ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED. To resolve this I needed to to update my nameservers with my domain registrar. This didn't happen as I could not log into my domain registrar account, don't know why. Trying to fix that now.
